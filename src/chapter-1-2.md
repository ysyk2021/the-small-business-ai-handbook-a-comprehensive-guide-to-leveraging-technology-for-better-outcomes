Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that has the potential to transform the way small businesses operate. AI refers to the ability of machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without human intervention.

In this chapter, we will provide an introduction to the basics of AI and its applications in small business.

What is AI?

AI encompasses a range of technologies including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns. Natural language processing involves teaching machines to understand and interpret human language. Computer vision involves teaching machines to interpret and analyze images.

AI can be used to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making processes, and identify new opportunities for growth.
