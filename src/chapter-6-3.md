AI-Enabled Personalization
--------------------------

AI-enabled personalization involves using algorithms and models to personalize the customer experience. This can include personalized product recommendations, tailored marketing campaigns, and customized service offerings.

For example, a small online retailer can use an AI-powered recommendation engine to suggest products based on a customer's browsing and purchase history, increasing the likelihood of making a sale. A small travel agency can use an AI-powered natural language processing tool to understand customer preferences and suggest personalized vacation packages, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

AI-Enabled Support
------------------

AI-enabled support involves using AI to provide customer support and assistance. This can include chatbots, virtual assistants, and natural language processing tools.

For example, a small food delivery service can use an AI-powered virtual assistant to take orders and answer customer inquiries, providing quick and accurate responses at all hours of the day. A small insurance company can use an AI-powered chatbot to provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, improving the overall customer experience.
