To successfully leverage AI technology, small businesses should create a roadmap for AI adoption that outlines their goals, identifies potential challenges, and establishes a plan for implementation. This roadmap should be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that AI adoption remains aligned with business goals and objectives.
